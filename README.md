TASK:

We first code up the Class method called minkowski which takes a single parameter r, and returns the Minkowki Distance between the two dictionaries. Note: you must include a phone rating in the distance calculation only if the phone was rated by both users.

Second, we code up the Class method called pearson which takes no parameters, and returns the Pearson Correlation between the two dictionaries. Note: you must include a phone rating in the correlation calculation only if the phone was rated by both users.

Create an object of class similarity. Initialize it with rating dictionaries UserPRatings and UserQRatings. Call the minkowski and pearson class methods to calculate the following measures between the two dictionaries:
o	Manhattan Distance
o	Euclidean Distance
o	Minkowski Distance (r=3)
o	Pearson Correlation
